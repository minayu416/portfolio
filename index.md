**[LUNA ACUARIO @MINA](https://minayu.site/en/)(2019/1- )**

My personal website, which represents the impression of myself and sharing positive concepts, knowledge, solutions and experiece. Related topics: software development, language learning, divination and other. Developed by Hugo, hosting on Github.

After the 2015 years, I awake from addiction of online games, I visited America and Nordic Europe, met people from Germany, Hungary, Australia in my university and travelers, they looked freedom, independent and expressing their ideas, which was very less in our culture. 

So I began to create my website and writing articles to share positive concepts, personal experience, inspirational stories and recording life after I escaped from from addiction of online games.

**[Miri Robot Fortune-Teller](https://minayu.site/miri-robot-fortune-teller/)(2017/11- )**

Own-developed divination and fortune-telling creative product, it moves the traditional flows of divination and fortune-telling to software and internet. 

I have touched fortune-telling since 2015 years, I used to use it for predicting future. But in these years, its new trend becames helping people find their original personalities, improving shortcomings or playing to strengths. 

I hope to use the power of technology to make a robot fortune-teller, it can give suitable suggestions and decisions according to the situation, current status and condition of the person, so that he/she can combine with his/her body, mind, and soul, and live a life he/she want.
